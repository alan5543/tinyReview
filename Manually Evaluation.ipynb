objective of our project is to develop and assess a Small Language Model (SLM) using the Amazon book review comments dataset. Our primary goal is to create a model capable of automatically generating customer comments. A critical aspect of our research is to explore how the quality of the dataset influences the text generation capabilities of our model.\n","\n","To investigate this, we have employed various preprocessing techniques on the dataset, resulting in four distinct versions, each aimed at examining a different aspect of data quality:\n","\n","- **Raw Data (Original Comments Dataset)**: This dataset retains the original, unaltered comments, offering the highest flexibility.\n","\n","- **Common Words Dataset**: This version includes comments specifically containing frequently appearing words.\n","\n","- **POS Filtered Dataset (Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives)**: Comments in this dataset are filtered to include only nouns, verbs, and adjectives.\n","\n","- **POS Filtered Dataset (Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Prepositions)**: This dataset represents the most structured version, with comments filtered to include nouns, verbs, adjectives, and prepositions.\n","\n","##Models\n","Each of the four datasets has been used to develop a corresponding model, all of which are hosted on HuggingFace:\n","\n","- **ChunB1/TinyReviews_raw**: Model trained on the Raw Data dataset.\n","- **ChunB1/TinyReviews_common**: Model trained on the Common Words dataset.\n","- **ChunB1/TinyReviews_adj**: Model trained on the POS Filtered dataset (Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives).\n","- **ChunB1/TinyReviews_adv**: Model trained on the POS Filtered dataset (Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Prepositions).\n","\n","\n","##Method\n","In addition to utilizing the GPT-Eval tool for initial evaluations, we recognize the necessity of human-based evaluation for language. Since large language models can act as 'black boxes' with limited explainability, human insight is invaluable for a comprehensive analysis.\n","\n","Our manual evaluation will consist of two key components:\n","\n","1. **Qualitative Analysis of Generated Comments**:\n","\n","- Creativity: Assessing the uniqueness and novelty in the generated comments.\n","- Grammar: Evaluating the grammatical correctness and fluency.\n","- Consistency: Ensuring the comments are contextually and thematically consistent, supported by specific examples.\n","\n","2. **Context-Based Manual Labelling**:\n","\n","- We will manually label the generated comments, focusing on the model's reasoning capabilities and the logical coherence of the comments.\n","Through this dual approach, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of how preprocessing techniques impact the effectiveness and quality of language models in generating human-like text.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"iRloN-SxapZk"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"sXrx8pccY5yl"},"outputs":[],"source":["from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM,
